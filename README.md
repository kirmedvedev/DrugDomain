# DrugDomain database
DrugDomain database [1] (http://prodata.swmed.edu/DrugDomain/) reports [ECOD](http://prodata.swmed.edu/ecod/index_af2_pdb.php) [2] domains of proteins that are targets for small molecules and drugs from [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/)

## Small molecule binding-associated Post Translational Modifications (PTMs) [3]
We identified PTMs within 10 Å of all atoms of each small molecule bound to all human proteins that have been analyzed and reported through the DrugDomain database. The overall non-redundant number of identified small molecule binding-associated PTMs is 6,131. This includes 30 types of PTMs (such as Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, etc.) and 47 combinations of PTM and amino acid types (for example Phosphorylation of SER, Acetylation of LYS, etc.)
